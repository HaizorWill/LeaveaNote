# We don't code, we fucking spaghetti it!
Small little project made for fun in 2 hours: basically a guest book or whatever you call it. Written in php, using composer and mongodb driver. All sources are available, use it as you wish, but not for production purposes as it is very insecure.

Little installation guide:
* Clone repo to your webserver's content directory, for example /var/www/LeaveaNote/
* Install php-fpm, preferrably 8.2+ and composer from https://getcomposer.org/, run composer install inside the project's directory
* Set up your web-server, don't forget fastCGI!
* Enjoy)
